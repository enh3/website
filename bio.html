                Kjel is a composer and multi-instrumentalist from Saskatchewan, currently living in Montréal. As an artist, he adores to construct and inhabit emotional soundspaces, from micro to macroscopic structures; intimately close to distant rumblings; quietude to profoundly sonorous. He is fascinated by the fragility of the transmission and reception of information both from one to another and within oneself; both lost fidelity and the incommunicable, as well as the juxtaposition of private and shared experience, and the play between the imagined and the real. In the fall of 2022, he embarked on a masters in composition at l’Université de Montréal where he is be exploring the pipe organ from a modern perspective, developing a hyper-instrument interface for the organ of l’église Saint-Édouard, where he’s been organist since July of 2022.
